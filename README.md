# First MarkDown webpage
My goal is to learn how to use GitHub and to become familiar within the world of the developer.

First experience using Git programmes (GitPod and gitHub):
1) Followed all steps, although I restarted everything after noticing that the CI template did not appear in GitPod. (I didn't yet know what I didn't know, and I deleted by first GitHub account and started again).
2) Spent three days figuring out how to "push" files to GitHub (to make the test site live). There seemed to be a problem connecting to the remote server. In the end, I created and added an SSH key, which resolved the issue. It also (at this point) seems more secure than entering password each time.
3) w3c markup validator: error - target_blank should not be used for images. Removed target="_blank" from all images.
4) w3c css validator: no issues.
